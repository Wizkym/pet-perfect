**Project Description**

Creating a website that allows the user to find pet shops, veterinarians, pet-friendly parks around the user. The user will input his/her zip-code in a input field. Once the zip code is submitted, the webpage will use the Google Maps API to generate a map that will show the nearest veterinarians, pet shops, and pet-friendly parks around the user. The app also allows users to find pets to adopt within a 25 mile radius of the location specified.
